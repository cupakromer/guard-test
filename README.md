Issue
-----

I've been trying to get [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) setup. It runs,
but I've been facing a frustrating issue where all of the tests run twice. I've
tried to reduce this to the simplest setup that reproduces the issue. This is
that setup.

Additionally, I'm running OS X 10.8.1.

  `Darwin 12.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 12.1.0: Tue Aug 14 13:29:55 PDT 2012; root:xnu-2050.9.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64`


Steps to Reproduce
------------------

  1. Clone the git repo

    `git clone https://github.com/cupakromer/guard-test.git`
    
  * Run `bundle` to install all the Gems
  * Start `guard` in debug mode
  
    `bundle exec guard --debug`

  * Edit the spec file `spec/lib/hello_spec.rb`
  * Just add a line that says `nil` anywhere in the file, then save.

    ```ruby
    require 'spec_helper'
    nil

    describe Hello do
      describe "#speak" do
        it "should say 'Hello friend'" do
          h = Hello.new
          h.speak("friend").should be "Hello friend"
        end
      end
    end
    ```


My Shell Output
---------------

  ```shell
  â€º bundle exec guard --debug
